> For now classes are saved as JSON dictionaries not classes, probably want to change that
    > In AdminApp there's a function that can convert IDs to classes
    > We'll do that later

> Write to file functions don't check if the file exists correctly

> MovieProgram needs to be layed out in a time table, Monday-Sunday, show a list of each day (time day tuple?)
    > Seats are American system

> Prices and stuff for the popcorn and drinks?

> Getter/Setter methods not really needed?
