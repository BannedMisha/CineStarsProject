"""
    This module handles all organisational stuff
    Things like add new items to the Popcorn Machineâ„¢ menu or changing the movie program
    While App is the interface for Users, AdminApp is the interface for whoever runs the cinema

    With this app, the owner can:
        >create instances of:
            >Cinema
            >Movie
            >MovieProgram
            >PopcornMachine
            >PopDrink
            >PopPopcorn
            >Theater
            >>Instances of User will NOT be created here but in App
            >>Instances of any class are stored externally in a JSON file
        >Change attributes of movies
        >Change the movie program

    Potential future functionality:
        >delete/ban a user

    General functionality:
        >organized function that lets admin create instances of classes

    TODO:
        >Graphical Interface
        >Find a way to convert the saved instances in JSON back into real instances of classes
